/* ~~ These are the columns for the layout. ~~ 

1) Padding is only placed on the top and/or bottom of the divs. The elements within these divs have padding on their sides. This saves you from any "box model math". Keep in mind, if you add any side padding or border to the div itself, it will be added to the width you define to create the *total* width. You may also choose to remove the padding on the element in the div and place a second div within it with no width and the padding necessary for your design.

2) No margin has been given to the columns since they are all floated. If you must add margin, avoid placing it on the side you're floating toward (for example: a right margin on a div set to float right). Many times, padding can be used instead. For divs where this rule must be broken, you should add a "display:inline" declaration to the div's rule to tame a bug where some versions of Internet Explorer double the margin.

3) Since classes can be used multiple times in a document (and an element can also have multiple classes applied), the columns have been assigned class names instead of IDs. For example, two sidebar divs could be stacked if necessary. These can very easily be changed to IDs if that's your preference, as long as you'll only be using them once per document.

4) If you prefer your nav on the right instead of the left, simply float these columns the opposite direction (all right instead of all left) and they'll render in reverse order. There's no need to move the divs around in the HTML source.

    <h2>Professional Background</h2>
    <p><img src="Images/TengHeadshot.jpg" alt="TengPicture" width="220" height="352" class="FloatRight" />I am a biology  teacher at Newman Smith High school, about to begin my 6th year in  the classroom.Â  I have been GT (Gifted and  Talented) certified, have participated in biology training with the National  Math + Science Initiative (NMSI) and the AP Institute. During the summer of  2015, I was privileged to participate program STARS (Science Teacher Access to  Resources at Southwestern) at UT Southwestern Medical center, assisting in the  research of Cystic Fibrosis.<br />
    I  have experience operating teleconferencing equipment for distance education  classes at the Texas A&amp;M School of Public Health. I also have experience  with the Adobe Creative suite. In addition to taking personal enrichment  courses related to the Adobe creative suite, I have had a summer job working on  newspaper ads for KAMU, the Bryan/College Station public broadcasting center. </p>

    <ul>
      <li>To learn how better to incorporate technology  into my classroom.</li>

    <h2>Multimedia Educational Technology Statement</h2>
    <p><em>&ldquo;We go to school for twelve or more years during our  childhoods and early adulthoods, and then we&rsquo;re done. But when the pace of  change gets this fast, the only way to retain a lifelong working capacity is to  engage in lifelong learning.&rdquo;</em> â Thomas L. Friedman (2017)</p>
    <p>      In my life time, I have seen overhead projectors replaced  with digital projectors. I went to high school without a cell phone, and now I  my students have smartphones. Â One of the  most advanced things my high school English teacher did was recorded assignments  on his voicemail. Now I am posting things on Google Classroom.Â  Facebook wasn&rsquo;t invented until I was in college,  now it is considered something for &ldquo;old people&rdquo;. While technology has many  drawbacks, and it is important to be cautious when implementing new technologies,  implementing new technologies is essential for preparing students for uncertain  future. </p>
    <p>      In order to maximize the use of learning technologies, &ldquo;we  must begin by deconstructing the issues of efficiency, effectiveness, and  productivity&rdquo;Â (Molenda, 2009). Often technology can  seem flashy, but not teach a single thing. As a teacher, I find Prezi, not much  more effective than PowerPoint, and it seems like it takes much longer to  create.Â  In order to maximize the use of  multimedia technology, teachers must be trained on how to use technology. In a  study of Los Angeles schools, it was &ldquo;found that access to equipment and software  seldom led to widespread teacher and student use. Most teachers were occasional  users or nonusers&rdquo; (Cuban, Kirkpatrick, &amp; Peck, 2001). </p>
    <p>      Despite its challenges, technology&rsquo;s benefits outweigh its costs.  When used properly, &ldquo;the use of images, along with words, diminishes the  overwhelming nature of text and helps the student to manage the cognitive load,  which increases retention&rdquo; (Sosnowski, 2008). As an educator, I can testify the  increases in engagement some of my students have had when they get to play  games like Kahoot, and Quizlet live.Â  No  implementation of technology will be perfect. However, it is important to  continue to experiment with new technologies.<br />
